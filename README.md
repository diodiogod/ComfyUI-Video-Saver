# ComfyUI Video Saver

Save videos with generation metadata in ComfyUI, while retaining the complete inherited Image Saver toolset.

This is a maintained fork of [alexopus/ComfyUI-Image-Saver](https://github.com/alexopus/ComfyUI-Image-Saver), extended with native ComfyUI and VideoHelperSuite video support. It remains a GitHub fork so upstream changes and attribution stay visible. Existing Image Saver node names are intentionally preserved for workflow compatibility.

The original project was itself forked from [giriss/comfy-image-saver](https://github.com/giriss/comfy-image-saver).

For images, the nodes save **generation metadata** compatible with Civitai geninfo detection. PNG, JPG, and WebP are supported. PNG stores the full ComfyUI workflow plus A1111-style parameters; JPEG/WebP store the A1111-style parameters. Model, LoRA, and embedding hashes are included for resource linking on Civitai.

You can find image examples in [`examples`](./examples) and the native/VHS video template in [`example_workflows`](./example_workflows).

You can also add LoRAs to the prompt in \<lora:name:weight\> format, which would be translated into hashes and stored together with the metadata. For this it is recommended to use `ImpactWildcardEncode` from the fantastic [ComfyUI-Impact-Pack](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Impact-Pack). It will allow you to convert the LoRAs directly to proper conditioning without having to worry about avoiding/concatenating lora strings, which have no effect in standard conditioning nodes. Here is an example:

## Video metadata

The video nodes preserve the same positive/negative prompts, settings, model and LoRA hashes, and Civitai resource list used by the image saver. Civitai now reads ComfyUI metadata natively from MP4 and WebM uploads ([Civitai PR #5147](https://github.com/civitai/civitai/pull/5147)). Videos saved with this version can use that native upload flow.

For native ComfyUI video workflows, use `Image Saver — Save Native Video (VIDEO + Audio)`. Connect the native `VIDEO` output from `Create Video` or another native video node to `video`, and connect `Image Saver Metadata` to `metadata`. This is the actual saver: it encodes the native frames plus optional audio, then adds metadata. Its filename prefix supports Image Saver placeholders such as `%time`, `%basemodelname`, and `%seed`.

For VideoHelperSuite, keep `save_metadata` enabled on `Video Combine`, then connect its `VHS_FILENAMES` output to `Image Saver — Add Metadata to VHS Video` and connect `Image Saver Metadata` to `metadata`. This is not another video encoder: it post-processes files already written by VHS and creates a suffixed MP4/WebM copy by default, preserving the original and all existing video/audio streams.

Both paths write a compact ComfyUI compatibility graph to `prompt`, built from the explicit Image Saver Metadata inputs. Civitai reads this graph to recover positive/negative prompts, seed, steps, sampler, scheduler, guidance, dimensions, and resolved resource versions. This graph describes the saved metadata; the original UI workflow remains the workflow to load in ComfyUI.

Keep `download_civitai_data` enabled on Image Saver Metadata to include resolved model-version IDs for native resource attribution. Existing AIR identifiers and version-ID-only records are supported. When lookup data is unavailable or disabled, recognizable model and LoRA filenames are retained, but native resource linking is not guaranteed from filenames alone.

With workflow embedding enabled, the original UI workflow stays in `workflow` and the unmodified execution graph is retained in `prompt_original`. With it disabled, the video still contains the small compatibility graph, but not the original workflow/execution graph. A1111 `parameters`, hashes, `civitaiResources`, and `extraMetadata` are retained for other readers.

The companion [Civitai Video Metadata Assistant](https://github.com/diodiogod/Civitai-Video-Metadata-Assistant) is an optional fallback for older videos, hash-based resource recovery, or metadata Civitai misses. Try the native upload with the extension disabled first; a browser extension is no longer required for the supported native path. Existing videos are not rewritten by updating this node pack.

This would have civitai autodetect all of the resources (assuming the model/lora/embedding hashes match):

## How to install?

### Method 1: Manager (Recommended)
Install this fork from its Git URL in *ComfyUI-Manager*:

`https://github.com/diodiogod/ComfyUI-Video-Saver`

Searching for “ComfyUI Image Saver” may install the upstream image-only project instead.

### Method 2: Easy
If you don't have *ComfyUI-Manager*, then:
- Using CLI, go to the ComfyUI folder
- `cd custom_nodes`
- `git clone https://github.com/diodiogod/ComfyUI-Video-Saver.git`
- `cd ComfyUI-Video-Saver`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Start/restart ComfyUI

## Customization of file/folder names

You can use following placeholders:

- `%date`
- `%time` *– format taken from `time_format`*
- `%time_format<format>` *– custom datetime format using Python strftime codes*
- `%model` *– full name of model file*
- `%basemodelname` *– name of model (without file extension)*
- `%seed`
- `%counter`
- `%counter<padding>` *– zero-padded counter (e.g. `%counter<03>` with counter 1 becomes `001`)*
- `%sampler_name`
- `%scheduler`
- `%steps`
- `%cfg`
- `%denoise`

Example:

| `filename` value | Result file name |
| --- | --- |
| `%time-%basemodelname-%cfg-%steps-%sampler_name-%scheduler-%seed` | `2023-11-16-131331-Anything-v4.5-pruned-mergedVae-7.0-25-dpm_2-normal-1_01.png` |
| `%time_format<%Y%m%d_%H%M%S>-%seed` | `20231116_131331-1.png` |
| `%time_format<%B %d, %Y> %basemodelname` | `November 16, 2023 Anything-v4.5.png` |
| `img_%time_format<%Y-%m-%d>_%seed` | `img_2023-11-16_1.png` |

**Common strftime format codes for `%time_format<format>`:**

| Code | Meaning | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| `%Y` | Year (4-digit) | 2023 |
| `%y` | Year (2-digit) | 23 |
| `%m` | Month (01-12) | 11 |
| `%B` | Month name (full) | November |
| `%b` | Month name (short) | Nov |
| `%d` | Day (01-31) | 16 |
| `%H` | Hour 24h | 13 |
| `%I` | Hour 12h | 01 |
| `%M` | Minute | 13 |
| `%S` | Second | 31 |
| `%p` | AM/PM | PM |
| `%A` | Weekday (full) | Thursday |
| `%a` | Weekday (short) | Thu |
| `%F` | YYYY-MM-DD | 2023-11-16 |
| `%T` | HH:MM:SS | 13:13:31 |

## Optional: Pipe Integration (Advanced Orchestration)

For orchestrating complicated workflows—such as projects involving dozens of character scenarios each with multiple scenes—the standard wiring can become dense. To help manage this, an optional **Pipe** system is available.

The pipe system bundles all metadata and image saver settings into a single connection, allowing you to pass them through a workflow and branch them efficiently.

### When Should I Need Pipe?

In most cases, the standard `ImageSaverMetadata`, `ImageSaverSimple`, or `ImageSaver` nodes are recommended, as the core features are identical.

The Pipe system is primarily beneficial when your workflow becomes crowded with wires between KSamplers and metadata nodes. It acts as an orchestrator, helping you maintain a cleaner generation pipeline in complex, multi-stage environments.

![Image Saver Pipe Workflow](images/image_saver_pipe.png)

#### Execution Order Observations (For Large Workflows)
Depending on your wiring strategy, ComfyUI may execute multiple KSamplers across the graph before reaching the corresponding `ImageSaverFromPipe` nodes. To optimize this, ensure that the branch containing an `ImageSaverFromPipe` node does not depend on resources from other active branches. This helps ComfyUI complete each branch sequentially, preventing unnecessary memory buildup.

For finer control in extremely large workflows, you can also use custom nodes that provide dedicated execution control.

### Features
* **Simplified Wiring:** Carries generation and saver settings in one pipe connection, useful for large-scale orchestration.
* **Deferred Execution:** Expensive operations like checkpoint hashing and Civitai API lookups are deferred until the final save operation.
* **Non-destructive Editing:** The `Edit Image Saver Pipe` node allows you to branch and modify settings. All string fields support the `[original]` placeholder (e.g., `[original], masterpiece`) to easily append or prepend text.
* **Orchestration Support:** Use the `Read Image Saver Pipe` to extract values for external manipulation before feeding them back into an `Edit` node.
* **Standard Dropdown Menus:** Sampler and scheduler inputs use combo boxes, allowing for easier direct connection to other nodes.

### Included Nodes
* **Make Image Saver Simple Config**: Standalone configuration for filename, path, and file type.
* **Make Image Saver Metadata Config**: Standalone configuration for prompts and generation parameters.
* **Make Image Saver Pipe**: Bundles the above configurations into a single pipe connection.
* **Edit Image Saver Pipe**: Overrides settings in an existing pipe (creates a new branch).
* **Read Image Saver Pipe**: Extracts settings from a pipe for inspection or external use.
* **Image Saver (From Pipe)**: Unpacks the pipe settings and saves the image.

### Workflow Consistency

The pipe system uses the same underlying logic as the standard nodes but is designed for a different workflow style.

* **Compatibility:** Standard nodes and pipe nodes have different input/output structures and are not directly interchangeable.
* **Execution Timing:** It is recommended to use one system consistently within a specific workflow branch. Standard nodes trigger side-effects (like metadata lookups) immediately upon execution. In contrast, pipe nodes defer these actions until the final saving step, allowing you to update metadata properties at multiple stages of your workflow before they are committed to disk.
